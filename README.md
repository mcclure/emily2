This is a test with the eventual aim of making a programming language interpreter. Right now all that's here is a parser for a sort of LISP-with-significant-whitespace. If you're looking for the actual Emily language, try [emilylang.org](emilylang.org).

To run a program, try:

	./emily.py ./test/exec/while.em

Or use `-e`:

	./emily.py -e 'println 47'

For other supported args run without arguments:

	./emily.py

To run the tests:

    ./develop/regression.py -a
