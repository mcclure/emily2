This is a test with the eventual aim of making a programming language interpreter. Right now all that's here is a parser for a sort of LISP-with-significant-whitespace. If you're looking for the actual Emily language, try [emilylang.org](emilylang.org).

Things you can do right now include disassemble a program:

	python emily.py --ast test/goal.em

Or run tests:

    ./develop/regression.py -a
