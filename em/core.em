# TODO: Important question to consider:
# Is it actually useful to have macro stages fit "between" parser and executable? 
# I think I originally imagined macros would update nodes to "at least" their own
# progress level, but in practice it seems macros only update targets all the way to
# "executable". Maybe macro-priority and progress should be two separate enums
